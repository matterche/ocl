PageTitle = Configure the severities for problems diagnosed by the LPG parser.

Preference_Severity_ByAlias = By Alias
Preference_Severity_ByAliasThenName = By Alias Then Name
Preference_Severity_ByName = By Name
	
Preference_Severity_Error = Error
Preference_Severity_Info = Info
Preference_Severity_Ok = Ok
Preference_Severity_Warning = Warning

LPG_AllOverloads = Consider all inherited overloaded operations, rather than just local operations,\nwhen selecting the called (static) operation.
LPG_AmbiguousAssociationEnds = Ambiguity when an unnavigable but named association end has the same name\nas the implicit name of an unnamed association end.
LPG_ClosureIterator = Use of the closure() iterator specified by OCL 2.3.
LPG_ConceptualOperationName = Use of an operation name conceptually as in 7.4.8.
LPG_DefinitionConstrainsFeature = Reference the defined property or operation in a def: expression as a constrained element\nof the constraint, in addition to the context classifier.
LPG_DynamicDispatch = Use the actual (dynamic) rather than the declared (static) source type\nto select the called operation.
LPG_ElementNameQuoteEscape = Use of "..." escape sequence for element names consisting\nof multiple OCL tokens.
LPG_ImplicitRootClass = Static instance for the implicit-root-class option token.
LPG_InheritedFeatureContext = Declaring (using the concrete syntax) an operation or property context in a classifier\nthat inherits the feature (rather than declaring a redefinition of the feature as the context).\nThis is allowed by the MDT OCL implementation but is not, strictly speaking, well-formed OCL.
LPG_LaxNullHandling = Implement lax handling of null values in certain OclAny-defined operations.
LPG_PackageLookupStrategy = Resolve package qualification by outward name lookup as specified by OCL 2.2,\nand/or by alias from an import declaration.
LPG_StringCaseConversion = Use of the toUpper() and toLower() operations on Strings.
LPG_StringSingleQuoteEscape = Use of '' escape sequence for single-quotes in string literals.
LPG_SupportStaticFeatures = Accept 'static' as part of a definition constraint as specified for OCL 2.2.
LPG_UseBackslashEscapeProcessing = Process Java-like backslash escape sequences as specified by OMG Issue 14357 for OCL 2.3
LPG_UseCompareToOperation = Interpolate <, <=, >, and >= operations when a model type defines a Java-style\ncompareTo(...) operation.
LPG_UseLongIntegers = Allow Integer Literals that exceed 32-bit limits.
LPG_WarnOfXorOrAndPrecedenceChange = Warn when the OCL 2.1 parsing of distinct xor, or, and precedences leads to\na different parse to the OCL 2.0 specification of all levels equal.
